      <p>
        I am in love with programming 💻. I enjoy doing random stuffs with it; increasing my productivity through it; 
        making a website with it; watching fun videos about it; making apps with it. To me it just feels like the possibilities
        are endless.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love gaming 🎲! I am a very competitive person in everything, I try to learn things fast like lightning 🌩️.
        For me competition is important, it pushes people to be better. Everytime I find peers with similar passion,
        I suddenly get the urge to learn more and do better than when I did before!

      <h1>Real Life 🧐</h1>
      <p>
        Outside the computer I am an active band member 🥁. I commit my free time to learning songs
        that we play in gigs when we're invited 🎶. I also jog from time to time to stay fit and motivated 🎽.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also spend a lot of time with my family 👪. Being a single child I'm really close to my parents.
        I also go out with my friends a lot 🧑‍🤝‍🧑. I am an extrovert who likes to have people around me time to time.
        I like drinking in coffee shops and going out window shopping techy products.
